Chloe Gabriel is a Law undergraduate as well as the Vice President of Warwick's
Speaking Society.

The talk will be discussing gentrification and whether it is a genuine cause
or concern. The talk will attempt to understand whether these objections are
valid or whether we have instead become obsessed with using the word to
describe necessary changes.
