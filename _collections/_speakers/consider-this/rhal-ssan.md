Rhal Ssan is in his final year studying Philosophy, Politics and Economics.

This talk will be considering society's use of drugs and why, throughout
history, mankind has consistently turned to them. This will then lead to
whether we should replace alcohol as the main recreational drug of use with
MDMA (ecstasy).
