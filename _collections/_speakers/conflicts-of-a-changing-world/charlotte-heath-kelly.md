Currently, Charlotte is the Principal Investigator on the Leverhulme Trust
project titled "The Political Life of Rubble: Bombsite Relics and Cosmopolitan
Identity." The project explores the way bombsite objects afford a symbolic
status as relics across time, from the World War II to the War on Terror.

This talk will explore the motivations of terrorism, as identified through
Charlotte's interviews with members of EOKA (a terrorist organisation based in
Cyprus). Charlotte is an Associate Professor and Researcher of the Politics and
International Studies Department of the University of Warwick. Her research
themes include post-disaster reconstruction; critical security studies and
critical terrorism studies; and counterterrorism in the UK and USA.
